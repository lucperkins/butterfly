Butterfly
=========

A Scala client for Riak.

This is very much a work in progress, so don't use it in for anything
serious. It is, however, being actively worked on, so feedback welcome.

I should also mention that Butterfly is build for compatibility with
Riak 2.0+ and is not designed for use with earlier versions.
